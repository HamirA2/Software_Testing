# Software_Testing

A school project I worked on to develop three classes and services based on specifications for a mobile application. Includes testing using JUnit testing cases to ensure each object from each class can be created per specifications, and to ensure each method works as intended, throwing error messages if either the object creation or methods are not used properly.
